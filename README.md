# Mare Fair 2025

This app is built using, mainly :
- Astro, see [documentation](https://docs.astro.build)
- Tailwind, see [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)
- Tailwind-typography and the Prose component, see [documentation](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography)

It's recommended to use Volta to keep in sync with the standard Node version, 22.
Node 22 comes with NPM 10.x and the project builds fine with it.
